📅 Day 16 — Working with JSON Files in Pandas
This folder contains my Day 16 learning work from the 100 Days of Machine Learning challenge. The focus was on reading and manipulating JSON data from both local sources and live APIs using pandas.

📘 What I Learned
The notebook covers the essential workflows for pd.read_json():

🔹 Local JSON Ingestion: Loading structured files like train.json into a tabular format.

🔹 API Integration: Fetching real-time data directly from a URL, such as live currency exchange rates.

🔹 Handling Nested Structures: Managing columns that contain lists or nested objects (e.g., recipe ingredients).

🔹 Metadata Analysis: Extracting supplementary information like API providers, timestamps, and base currency terms.
