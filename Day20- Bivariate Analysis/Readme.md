## 📄 Datasets Used

- train.csv — Titanic dataset

### Seaborn built-in datasets:

- iris — flower measurements and species

- flights — monthly airline passenger counts

- tips — restaurant tipping data

## 🔍 What’s Covered

### Analysis of:

- Numerical vs Numerical variables

- Categorical vs Numerical variables

### Visualizations:

- Scatter plots

- Box plots

- Bar plots

- Discovery of trends, patterns, and correlations

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how features interact with each other and build intuition for deeper EDA and machine learning modeling.
