# 📊 Pandas Profiling — Automated EDA Report Generation

This folder is part of my 100 Days of Machine Learning journey and focuses on using **Pandas Profiling (ydata-profiling)** to automatically generate comprehensive exploratory data analysis reports.

## 📁 Contents

* `Pandas Profiling.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook demonstrating automated EDA report generation
* `train.csv` — Titanic dataset used for profiling
* `output.html` — Generated HTML report with complete dataset analysis

## 📄 Dataset Used

* **Titanic Dataset** (`train.csv`) — passenger survival data with demographics and ticket information

## 🔍 What's Covered

* Installation and setup of `ydata-profiling` (formerly `pandas-profiling`)
* Generating automated EDA reports with a single command
* Understanding comprehensive data insights including:
  * Dataset overview and statistics
  * Variable distributions and correlations
  * Missing values analysis
  * Duplicate rows detection
  * Sample data preview
  * Alerts and warnings about data quality

## 💡 Key Features

* **One-line report generation** — complete EDA with minimal code
* **Interactive HTML reports** — exportable and shareable analysis
* **Automated insights** — correlation matrices, distribution plots, and statistical summaries
* **Time-saving** — replaces hours of manual EDA work

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how automated profiling tools can quickly generate comprehensive exploratory data analysis reports, allowing data scientists to understand datasets faster and focus on modeling and insights.

## ⚠️ Note

This project uses `ydata-profiling`, the actively maintained successor to the deprecated `pandas-profiling` package. The newer version is compatible with Python 3.13+ and provides enhanced features and better performance.
