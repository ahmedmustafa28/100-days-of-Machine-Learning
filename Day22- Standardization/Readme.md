# ⚙️ Feature Scaling — Standardization

This folder is part of my 100 Days of Machine Learning journey and focuses on feature scaling using Standardization, a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning.

## 📁 Contents

- Feature Scaling - Standarization.ipynb

### 📄 Datasets Used

- Social_Network_Ads.csv — used to demonstrate the effect of standardization on features with different scales

## 🔍 What’s Covered

- Why feature scaling is important

- Standardization (Z-score normalization)

- Effect of scaling on feature distribution

- Comparison of data before and after scaling

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how standardization brings features to a common scale and improves the performance of distance-based and gradient-based machine learning algorithms.
