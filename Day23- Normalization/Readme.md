# ⚙️ Feature Scaling — Normalization

This folder is part of my 100 Days of Machine Learning journey and focuses on feature scaling using Normalization, an essential data preprocessing technique.

## 📁 Contents

- Feature Scaling - Normalization.ipynb

### 📄 Datasets Used

- Social_Network_Ads.csv — used to demonstrate normalization on features with different value ranges

## 🔍 What’s Covered

- Importance of feature scaling

- Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)

- Effect of normalization on data range

- Comparison of data before and after scaling

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how normalization scales features to a fixed range and why it is useful for distance-based machine learning algorithms.
